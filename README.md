# Machine-Learning-Project

Machine Learning :
In folder ex1:
- Predicted the houseing price using linear regression with multiple varibles

In folder ex2:
- Predicted whether student get admitted into university by logistic regression model
- Predicted whether microchips from fabrication plant passes quality assurance using regularized logistic regression

In folder ex3:
- Worked with one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits

In folder ex4:
- Implement backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and applied to task of hand-written digit recognition

In folder ex5:
- Implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with diferent bias-variance properties

Note: 
- Please use MATLAB software to run the file, I personally used MATLAB Online to run these files. 
- Please put the ex3data1.mat in folder ex3 and ex4data1.mat in folder ex4 before excuting the files.
- Run .mlx file in each folder to see the results ;-)
